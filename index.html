            <h1>What are the causes and treatment principles of cancer in Chinese herbs?
Chinese herbal medicine believes that cancer is an accumulation of toxic and Qi, so treatment of cancer requires dispersal of the poison and dispersal of qi!
Treatments to disperse the poison are the Chinese herbs like Baiwashekao and Scutellaria indica. Of course, there are many prescriptions for Chinese herbs to nourish the internal organs and boost immunity.
However, the current weakness of Chinese herbs is the lack of treatment plans to disperse Qi.
Nowadays China's cancer treatment program is a combination of Chinese and Western methods. However, the mortality rate is very high and the survival rate is less than 15%.
What is Qi, Qi is an accumulation of energy. We believe that if our bodycannot disperse the energy stores in the body and form cancer! Qi radiates from the surface of the body and limbs.
So bathing in cold water is a way to breathe. Every time you take a bath with cold water, you lie quietly on the bed and caress your cold body. If your body does not warm up in about 20 minutes, you will find that it is blocked by blood vessels and meridians, and you will strengthen your massage on the cold place! Then you can disperse Qi.
Also do a lot massage to your fingers can also disperse Qi,because Qi radiates from the surface of the body and limbs.
in a words, cancer is a lack of balance of your body,Due to nervousness and physical and chemical stimulation caused by intense nerve movement and abnormal discharge, it is caused by not being relieved.</h1>

                    <p>Two parts of the body are "itchy". Don't mistake it for an allergy or a sign of liver cancer. Be alert</p>
                    <p>The liver is the "first of the five internal organs". It can not only synthesize, secrete, and metabolize, but also detoxify and detoxify, which is very important to the human body.
However, the liver is also a well-known "painless" organ. If it is abnormal, it will not feel particularly obvious. Therefore, in order to effectively care for the health of the liver, in addition to having a good diet and living habits, we must also pay more attention to abnormalities in the body, or to quickly find liver disease.

Two parts of the body are "itchy". Don't mistake it for an allergy or a sign of liver cancer. Be alert
1. Itchy skin
Skin itching is generally considered to be caused by allergies or mosquito bites, but if itching occurs suddenly within a period of time, or it is a signal before liver cancer is coming, pay attention.
After the liver disease occurs, the body's metabolic capacity will be reduced to a certain extent, and the bile cannot be smoothly sent to the intestines and stomach to help digestion. When too much cholestasis is accumulated in the gallbladder, a part of it will enter the blood and follow the blood circulation throughout the body. When the bile salts in the bile take the opportunity to gather under the skin, it will stimulate the nerve endings and cause inexplicable itching of the skin.

2. Itchy eyes
Eyes are the weaker parts of the body. If you use your eyes for a long time and do not pay attention to rest, your eyes will become dry and itchy. However, if you use your eyes normally, your eyes will still be abnormal, or liver cancer will come to your home.
After the liver develops a problem, the blood storage capacity will decrease, and the liver blood will be insufficient, so that the eyes will not receive sufficient blood nourishment, and the eyes will appear dry and itchy.

Why is liver cancer more and more? The doctor said bluntly: these 3 foods are not superficial to the liver, so avoid them as soon as possible
1. Moldy food
Moldy food is a gathering place for a large number of bacteria and fungi, and it also contains a strong carcinogen aflatoxin. If you encounter this kind of food, don't be reluctant to throw it away. Just cut off the moldy place and continue eating the rest. This will pose a serious safety hazard.
Studies have shown that intake of 1 mg of aflatoxin will cause a large number of liver cell deaths and liver disease. For good health, always pay attention to throw away moldy food as soon as possible.

2. Long-bubble fungi
Fungus, which contains a lot of nutrients, is also a food that people often eat. However, attention should be paid to the way of eating this kind of food. Improper way of eating will make it a "liver-damaging weapon."
For example, the common fungus is bought dry in general households and soaked when eating. However, if the soaking time is too long, it is easy to be contaminated by bacteria in the air and breed the toxic substance rice yeast. Once this substance enters the human body, it will cause great damage to the liver, causing massive lesions and necrosis of liver cells, and in severe cases, liver cancer.

3. Alcoholic drinks
Alcohol is a must-have drink for social occasions, but if you don’t control the amount of alcohol you drink, it will also cause great damage to your liver.
The liver is the main place for alcohol metabolism. 90% of the alcohol you drink can be catabolized and metabolized with the help of the liver. If you drink frequently, the liver will be overloaded with work and liver function will be affected. In addition, the main ingredient in wine is ethanol. After it enters the human body and is decomposed, it will form acetaldehyde that can damage liver cells and cause rapid liver disease.

The most important thing is to prevent the liver as early as possible. It is recommended to do these 3 things
1. Drink plenty of water
Drinking water can replenish body fluids and create a humid metabolic environment for the liver, allowing the liver to work efficiently. Drinking plenty of water can also help repair liver cells and make the liver healthier.
For people with poor liver, the effect of drinking plain water is not high. You can also put two or three PTZ ice chrysanthemums in the water cup to double the effect.
Yuntai ice chrysanthemum is a subspecies of Huai chrysanthemum produced in the ancient Huaiqing Mansion (Jiaozuo, Henan). It contains selenium, choline, flavonoids and other liver-nourishing ingredients. It is also known as the "king of chrysanthemum".

Medical certificate:
Selenium can accelerate the metabolism of toxins, increase the metabolic rate of the liver, and protect liver health;
Choline can quickly metabolize fat and reduce the burden on the liver. It is known as a "hepatic expert";
Flavonoids can quickly scavenge free radicals in the body and reduce the chance of liver cell damage.
Drinking 1 cup every day after meals can help the liver to metabolize faster and effectively improve liver function. The liver will appreciate you.


2. Exercise more
Exercise is good for the body. Regular exercise can not only promote blood circulation, quickly clear out garbage and toxins in the body, reduce siltation, but also improve the liver's ability to resist harmful substances and reduce the chance of liver disease.
It is best to stick to one hour of exercise every day, and choose aerobic exercises that suit you, such as running, yoga, Tai Chi, etc. These exercises are relatively low in intensity, and can quickly consume excess fat and have a good liver maintenance effect. .

3. Eat a balanced diet and eat less greasy
As the saying goes: All diseases come out of the mouth, and the development of scientific eating habits is of great benefit to the body.
In normal meals, you should ensure a balanced intake of various nutrients. Don't be picky eaters, don't eat too oily, and try to eat more vegetables. Vegetables contain a lot of cellulose, which can help the body digest, expel fat and garbage in the body, reduce the burden on the liver, and maintain liver vitality.

            <h1>Are there any toxic side effects in taking Chinese medicine for a long time? Cancer patients who have eaten for more than ten years...


Regarding this problem, our Chinese medicine practitioners pay attention to good results and do not change the prescription.

Because after taking this medicine for a month or two or three or five months, if the patient rechecks the tumor size to stabilize or shrink, then we think this medicine is still more suitable for you and will make you stick to the medicine. If there are changes in symptoms and conditions, we will adjust the medicine for you. It's like a targeted drug of western medicine. If it doesn't have drug resistance, it won't be changed. Why change? After changing, they may not adapt. We also have a patient who asks to change prescriptions every week. He said to me to adjust it a little bit if it is uncomfortable and a little bit uncomfortable. As a result, I found that I didn’t adapt for the first two or three days after each adjustment, and then he adapted again. . Later, a leader gave him a synthesis and did not change, and slowly he asked not to transfer, and he continued to eat.

I have a patient with a relatively large malignant tumor in the bronchus. At the beginning, I cried and cried every time. My daughter came with her every month. After taking Chinese medicine for two years, I said it’s okay. coming. Her daughter is now helping to dispense the medicine. Every time I watch her video, her face is ruddy, her tongue coating is also very good, and the tumor shrinks after the hospital review. For patients who are stable in all aspects like this, there is no need to change the prescription.

Are there any side effects of taking Chinese medicine for a long time?



As the saying goes, medicine is three points poison, but if it is right, it is not poison, and if it is wrong, it is poison. For example, if your body is irritable and yang is hyperactive, then if you eat ginseng, it will become poison; if you eat rhubarb if your yang is hyperactive and your stools are dry and clumpy, if you give you rhubarb, you will feel comfortable and rhubarb will become a tonic. , So the symptomatically suitable for you is not poison.

Many Chinese medicines are both medicinal and food. Long-term use is no problem. Even if some Chinese medicines that are harmful to the body or have toxic side effects after long-term use, we will be very cautious in processing and dosage. If the patient takes a few times When the situation improves, we will withdraw from the prescription. Generally, we will use milder drugs that are both anti-tumor and non-harmful.

Why it is better to treat tumors with integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine



Tumor is a highly difficult disease to treat. Tumors develop relatively quickly. With only Western medicine, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy, the treatment process of this disease may not persist. For example, if you are dying after surgery, if you can restore your righteousness after taking Chinese medicine, you can also achieve a goal in treating tumors. There are also some tumors that cannot be operated, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Taking Chinese medicine is also a good choice because you can take Chinese medicine. You can go for surgery when you are well.

In addition, some tumors may take a long time to recover after only taking Chinese medicine, or the tumor may progress very quickly, and it may not be controlled by taking Chinese medicine alone. Then there are three axes of Western medicine that we can use. The good things of our Chinese medicine are also used by Western medicine. For example, arsenic trioxide injection for the treatment of leukemia is extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine arsenic. In addition, paclitaxel in western medicine is also extracted from yew, so western medicine targeted drugs for radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be used in Chinese medicine.

Modern Chinese medicine cannot simply emphasize that our Chinese medicine is better, because two fists are better than one fist. Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are like two legs of a person. Walking on two legs is definitely better than one leg. Therefore, in the process of treating tumors, we will make comprehensive considerations according to the changes in the condition and the needs of the condition. For some who can be operated, we recommend that they be treated after surgery. For example, the effect of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is very good. We will recommend that he first take radiotherapy and then take traditional Chinese medicine. Leukemia and lymphoma are effective for chemotherapy. Then chemotherapy first, then traditional Chinese medicine or chemotherapy while taking traditional Chinese medicine can achieve better treatment goals. .

Our treatment is to put the patient's recovery first. So we often tell patients that whether a white cat or a black cat catches a mouse is a good cat.</h1>
