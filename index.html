            <h2>What are the causes and treatment principles of cancer in Chinese herbs?
Chinese herbal medicine believes that cancer is an accumulation of toxic and Qi, so treatment of cancer requires dispersal of the poison and dispersal of qi!
Treatments to disperse the poison are the Chinese herbs like Baiwashekao and Scutellaria indica. Of course, there are many prescriptions for Chinese herbs to nourish the internal organs and boost immunity.
However, the current weakness of Chinese herbs is the lack of treatment plans to disperse Qi.
Nowadays China's cancer treatment program is a combination of Chinese and Western methods. However, the mortality rate is very high and the survival rate is less than 15%.
What is Qi, Qi is an accumulation of energy. We believe that if our bodycannot disperse the energy stores in the body and form cancer! Qi radiates from the surface of the body and limbs.
So bathing in cold water is a way to breathe. Every time you take a bath with cold water, you lie quietly on the bed and caress your cold body. If your body does not warm up in about 20 minutes, you will find that it is blocked by blood vessels and meridians, and you will strengthen your massage on the cold place! Then you can disperse Qi.
Also do a lot massage to your fingers can also disperse Qi,because Qi radiates from the surface of the body and limbs.
in a words, cancer is a lack of balance of your body,Due to nervousness and physical and chemical stimulation caused by intense nerve movement and abnormal discharge, it is caused by not being relieved.</h2>

                    <p>Two parts of the body are "itchy". Don't mistake it for an allergy or a sign of liver cancer. Be alert</p>
                    <h3>The liver is the "first of the five internal organs". It can not only synthesize, secrete, and metabolize, but also detoxify and detoxify, which is very important to the human body.
However, the liver is also a well-known "painless" organ. If it is abnormal, it will not feel particularly obvious. Therefore, in order to effectively care for the health of the liver, in addition to having a good diet and living habits, we must also pay more attention to abnormalities in the body, or to quickly find liver disease.

Two parts of the body are "itchy". Don't mistake it for an allergy or a sign of liver cancer. Be alert
1. Itchy skin
Skin itching is generally considered to be caused by allergies or mosquito bites, but if itching occurs suddenly within a period of time, or it is a signal before liver cancer is coming, pay attention.
After the liver disease occurs, the body's metabolic capacity will be reduced to a certain extent, and the bile cannot be smoothly sent to the intestines and stomach to help digestion. When too much cholestasis is accumulated in the gallbladder, a part of it will enter the blood and follow the blood circulation throughout the body. When the bile salts in the bile take the opportunity to gather under the skin, it will stimulate the nerve endings and cause inexplicable itching of the skin.

2. Itchy eyes
Eyes are the weaker parts of the body. If you use your eyes for a long time and do not pay attention to rest, your eyes will become dry and itchy. However, if you use your eyes normally, your eyes will still be abnormal, or liver cancer will come to your home.
After the liver develops a problem, the blood storage capacity will decrease, and the liver blood will be insufficient, so that the eyes will not receive sufficient blood nourishment, and the eyes will appear dry and itchy.

Why is liver cancer more and more? The doctor said bluntly: these 3 foods are not superficial to the liver, so avoid them as soon as possible
1. Moldy food
Moldy food is a gathering place for a large number of bacteria and fungi, and it also contains a strong carcinogen aflatoxin. If you encounter this kind of food, don't be reluctant to throw it away. Just cut off the moldy place and continue eating the rest. This will pose a serious safety hazard.
Studies have shown that intake of 1 mg of aflatoxin will cause a large number of liver cell deaths and liver disease. For good health, always pay attention to throw away moldy food as soon as possible.

2. Long-bubble fungi
Fungus, which contains a lot of nutrients, is also a food that people often eat. However, attention should be paid to the way of eating this kind of food. Improper way of eating will make it a "liver-damaging weapon."
For example, the common fungus is bought dry in general households and soaked when eating. However, if the soaking time is too long, it is easy to be contaminated by bacteria in the air and breed the toxic substance rice yeast. Once this substance enters the human body, it will cause great damage to the liver, causing massive lesions and necrosis of liver cells, and in severe cases, liver cancer.

3. Alcoholic drinks
Alcohol is a must-have drink for social occasions, but if you don’t control the amount of alcohol you drink, it will also cause great damage to your liver.
The liver is the main place for alcohol metabolism. 90% of the alcohol you drink can be catabolized and metabolized with the help of the liver. If you drink frequently, the liver will be overloaded with work and liver function will be affected. In addition, the main ingredient in wine is ethanol. After it enters the human body and is decomposed, it will form acetaldehyde that can damage liver cells and cause rapid liver disease.

The most important thing is to prevent the liver as early as possible. It is recommended to do these 3 things
1. Drink plenty of water
Drinking water can replenish body fluids and create a humid metabolic environment for the liver, allowing the liver to work efficiently. Drinking plenty of water can also help repair liver cells and make the liver healthier.
For people with poor liver, the effect of drinking plain water is not high. You can also put two or three PTZ ice chrysanthemums in the water cup to double the effect.
Yuntai ice chrysanthemum is a subspecies of Huai chrysanthemum produced in the ancient Huaiqing Mansion (Jiaozuo, Henan). It contains selenium, choline, flavonoids and other liver-nourishing ingredients. It is also known as the "king of chrysanthemum".

Medical certificate:
Selenium can accelerate the metabolism of toxins, increase the metabolic rate of the liver, and protect liver health;
Choline can quickly metabolize fat and reduce the burden on the liver. It is known as a "hepatic expert";
Flavonoids can quickly scavenge free radicals in the body and reduce the chance of liver cell damage.
Drinking 1 cup every day after meals can help the liver to metabolize faster and effectively improve liver function. The liver will appreciate you.


2. Exercise more
Exercise is good for the body. Regular exercise can not only promote blood circulation, quickly clear out garbage and toxins in the body, reduce siltation, but also improve the liver's ability to resist harmful substances and reduce the chance of liver disease.
It is best to stick to one hour of exercise every day, and choose aerobic exercises that suit you, such as running, yoga, Tai Chi, etc. These exercises are relatively low in intensity, and can quickly consume excess fat and have a good liver maintenance effect. .

3. Eat a balanced diet and eat less greasy
As the saying goes: All diseases come out of the mouth, and the development of scientific eating habits is of great benefit to the body.
In normal meals, you should ensure a balanced intake of various nutrients. Don't be picky eaters, don't eat too oily, and try to eat more vegetables. Vegetables contain a lot of cellulose, which can help the body digest, expel fat and garbage in the body, reduce the burden on the liver, and maintain liver vitality.

            <h3>Are there any toxic side effects in taking Chinese medicine for a long time? Cancer patients who have eaten for more than ten years...


Regarding this problem, our Chinese medicine practitioners pay attention to good results and do not change the prescription.

Because after taking this medicine for a month or two or three or five months, if the patient rechecks the tumor size to stabilize or shrink, then we think this medicine is still more suitable for you and will make you stick to the medicine. If there are changes in symptoms and conditions, we will adjust the medicine for you. It's like a targeted drug of western medicine. If it doesn't have drug resistance, it won't be changed. Why change? After changing, they may not adapt. We also have a patient who asks to change prescriptions every week. He said to me to adjust it a little bit if it is uncomfortable and a little bit uncomfortable. As a result, I found that I didn’t adapt for the first two or three days after each adjustment, and then he adapted again. . Later, a leader gave him a synthesis and did not change, and slowly he asked not to transfer, and he continued to eat.

I have a patient with a relatively large malignant tumor in the bronchus. At the beginning, I cried and cried every time. My daughter came with her every month. After taking Chinese medicine for two years, I said it’s okay. coming. Her daughter is now helping to dispense the medicine. Every time I watch her video, her face is ruddy, her tongue coating is also very good, and the tumor shrinks after the hospital review. For patients who are stable in all aspects like this, there is no need to change the prescription.

Are there any side effects of taking Chinese medicine for a long time?



As the saying goes, medicine is three points poison, but if it is right, it is not poison, and if it is wrong, it is poison. For example, if your body is irritable and yang is hyperactive, then if you eat ginseng, it will become poison; if you eat rhubarb if your yang is hyperactive and your stools are dry and clumpy, if you give you rhubarb, you will feel comfortable and rhubarb will become a tonic. , So the symptomatically suitable for you is not poison.

Many Chinese medicines are both medicinal and food. Long-term use is no problem. Even if some Chinese medicines that are harmful to the body or have toxic side effects after long-term use, we will be very cautious in processing and dosage. If the patient takes a few times When the situation improves, we will withdraw from the prescription. Generally, we will use milder drugs that are both anti-tumor and non-harmful.

Why it is better to treat tumors with integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine



Tumor is a highly difficult disease to treat. Tumors develop relatively quickly. With only Western medicine, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy, the treatment process of this disease may not persist. For example, if you are dying after surgery, if you can restore your righteousness after taking Chinese medicine, you can also achieve a goal in treating tumors. There are also some tumors that cannot be operated, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Taking Chinese medicine is also a good choice because you can take Chinese medicine. You can go for surgery when you are well.

In addition, some tumors may take a long time to recover after only taking Chinese medicine, or the tumor may progress very quickly, and it may not be controlled by taking Chinese medicine alone. Then there are three axes of Western medicine that we can use. The good things of our Chinese medicine are also used by Western medicine. For example, arsenic trioxide injection for the treatment of leukemia is extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine arsenic. In addition, paclitaxel in western medicine is also extracted from yew, so western medicine targeted drugs for radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be used in Chinese medicine.

Modern Chinese medicine cannot simply emphasize that our Chinese medicine is better, because two fists are better than one fist. Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are like two legs of a person. Walking on two legs is definitely better than one leg. Therefore, in the process of treating tumors, we will make comprehensive considerations according to the changes in the condition and the needs of the condition. For some who can be operated, we recommend that they be treated after surgery. For example, the effect of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is very good. We will recommend that he first take radiotherapy and then take traditional Chinese medicine. Leukemia and lymphoma are effective for chemotherapy. Then chemotherapy first, then traditional Chinese medicine or chemotherapy while taking traditional Chinese medicine can achieve better treatment goals. .

Our treatment is to put the patient's recovery first. So we often tell patients that whether a white cat or a black cat catches a mouse is a good cat.</h3>

                    <p>How to judge that there is cancer in the body?.</p>
                    <p>There is cancer in the body, and there are often three signs in the abdomen. If you have all of them, it indicates that it is time for a physical examination



Which parts of the body have the most organs? There is no doubt that it is the abdomen. Because it has the most organs, the abdomen is also the site with the most cancers, such as stomach cancer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, bile duct cancer, small bowel cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, Kidney cancer, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer are all cancers of the abdomen.

The question is, since there are so many cancers in the abdomen, how can we identify them? Which signs should be paid special attention to?

First, abdominal pain. Over time, the most common symptom caused by cancer in the abdomen is abdominal pain. The nature, location, degree of abdominal pain caused by cancer in different parts of the body are also different with or without radiating pain, such as liver cancer. Right upper abdominal pain, pancreatic cancer often causes upper-middle abdominal pain, liver cancer is often accompanied by right shoulder pain, and pancreatic cancer is often accompanied by low back pain.



Second, abdominal masses. As the cancer progresses, masses will form in the abdomen. For example, when liver cancer comes, there will be masses in the upper right abdomen. For example, when colorectal cancer comes, there will be masses in the right lower abdomen or left lower abdomen. Masses, masses caused by malignant tumors, have a hard texture, often unclear borders, and poor mobility. At this time, we must be alert to malignant tumors and it is best to check in time.

Third, ascites. Many patients find malignant tumors because of unexplained ascites. Malignant tumors such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer can all cause ascites. This kind of abdominal effusion Effusion is often malignant. If pathological examination of ascites is performed, malignant tumor cells can often be found.

If there are three of the above three signs, it indicates that the physical examination is required. There are many options for abdominal examination, such as abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, abdominal CT, MRI, and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Cancer can be found.

Abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, CT, and MRI can help find malignant tumors of the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, urinary system and ovary. Gastroscopy can help find gastric cancer, and colonoscopy can help find colorectal cancer.

                    <h1>the advantage of chinese medicine for cancer cure.</h1>
                    <h3>Cancer can be cured by taking a few Chinese medicines? Come and see the truth

As far as current medical technology is concerned, the commonly used treatment method for cancer is chemotherapy. The same facts have proved that this is also a very effective method, but it will bring indelible harm to the patient’s psychology and physiology, and it will regularly Quantitative chemotherapy treatment will also bring considerable financial pressure to the family. However, Chinese medicine is very cheap and popular, and it is also sold in general pharmacies.


Generally, people who receive chemotherapy will lose their hair, because the body cannot withstand such high-intensity treatment. Chemotherapy is equivalent to changing blood. The effect is obvious, but the possibility of recurrence is also high. The most important thing is There will be greater harm to the person's own physical condition, and every time they receive such high-intensity treatment, the patient's psychology will also be under great pressure.



So are there any other easy and effective ways to prevent and control cancer?

Our traditional Chinese medicine is also very powerful, and the anti-cancer anti-cancer medicine advocated by Chinese medicine has obvious effects in the prevention and control of cancer. Although traditional Chinese medicine is not as effective as Western medical methods such as chemotherapy, and the prevention and control of traditional Chinese medicine is a gradual process for cancer prevention and control, it has to be said that it does not do so much harm to the body, and because traditional Chinese medicine is made of pure herbs, it is It is purely natural and pollution-free, so the human body will not have such a big rejection reaction to it.

Another disadvantage of Western medicine is that most of its drugs are dependent. If you use Western medicine for treatment for a long time, your body will often have strong resistance to that medicine. Without its medicinal effect, the therapeutic effect is not great.



And Chinese medicine is just the opposite. Chinese medicine needs to be taken for a long time, and it has a good break-in time with the human body, because traditional Chinese medicine is mainly to slowly adjust the human body during the long-term taking process, so that the human body It can produce anti-cancer substances by itself. This kind of treatment is generally more complete and the chance of recurrence is less. However, because it requires a longer treatment time, it is generally necessary to treat with Chinese medicine at the early stage of the onset. It is at the stage of preventing cancer.


The medicinal properties of traditional Chinese medicine are relatively mild, and have excellent effects on the treatment and prevention of cancer. Therefore, we can also drink some Chinese herbal medicines to nourish the body, improve our own resistance, and improve the ability to prevent cancer, so that terrible cancers can no longer be used. There are opportunities.

Of course, when we choose the Chinese herbal medicines we want to drink, we must go to a professional doctor for consultation, and ask professional doctors to formulate a prescription that suits us. But "the medicine is three-point poison", so we also drink Chinese herbal medicines. Be sure to keep his amount within one range and not eat too much at once.

                    <h3> Advanced bowel cancer, only half a year from diagnosis to death, there are four major symptoms, check it as soon as possible
December 26, 2020




The 55-year-old Mr. Liu has had blood in the stool for four months for unexplained reasons, but he has always believed that he has only ordinary hemorrhoids and has been treated according to hemorrhoids. However, within four months, Mr. Liu’s blood in the stool has not improved. , On the contrary, it became more and more serious. At the same time, he showed abdominal pain and bloating. In order to find out the cause, Mr. Liu was accompanied by his family to the hospital. After the examination, he was quickly determined to be rectal cancer. What's worse, he was diagnosed with cancer. The cells have undergone liver metastasis.



After Mr. Liu was diagnosed with advanced rectal cancer, although many treatment methods such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted drug therapy were adopted, none of these methods ultimately saved Mr. Liu’s life. Only half a year after his diagnosis, Mr. Liu passed away. .



Advanced colorectal cancer, only half a year from diagnosis to death, the doctor said, most advanced colorectal cancer patients, the survival rate of more than half a year is actually very low, this is because cancer cells have metastasized widely, and colorectal cancer is the most easily metastatic site It is the liver. For the human body, the role of the liver is very important. When liver metastases occur, the quality of life of the patient will not only decrease significantly, but also manifestations such as jaundice, ascites, loss of appetite, weight loss, and abdominal pain.







Speaking of this, many people will ask, if symptoms occur, it seems that they cannot be delayed. If it is bowel cancer, it is easy to metastasize.



First, blood in the stool. Once there is blood in the stool, the first reaction of many people is hemorrhoids. In fact, colon cancer can also cause it, especially rectal cancer, which can easily cause blood in the stool, or even bleeding after the stool. Misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids.



Second, changes in stool characteristics. When bowel cancer comes, it is easy to cause changes in stool characteristics. The main manifestation is that the stool becomes thinner and looks like thin strips, like squeezed toothpaste.



Third, changes in bowel habits. When bowel cancer comes, many patients will also experience changes in bowel habits, manifested as irregular bowel movements, increased stool frequency, and decreased stool frequency.



Fourth, abdominal pain, weight loss and anemia, bowel cancer can cause a series of systemic manifestations, such as abdominal pain, weight loss and anemia.



So far, the best way to diagnose bowel cancer is colonoscopy. For those with the above four symptoms, no matter what they are, it is best to check in time.</h3>

            <h2>The colon has started to become cancerous, and there will be four signs in the stool. If you have all four, it is time for a physical examination



There is one type of cancer that must not be ignored, and that is colon cancer. Data shows that the incidence of colon cancer in our country firmly occupies the third place among malignant tumors, known as the third oldest cancer.

So the question is, when colon cancer comes, what special signs will the body have?

Many people do not know the main function of the colon. After the food passes through the small intestine, almost all the nutrients in the food have been absorbed. The remaining food residue reaches the colon. The colon further absorbs the water and electrolytes in it, and the rest is with Intestinal mucus and bacteria in the intestine together form the human feces, which are eventually excreted.

Since the colon is the place where stool is produced and discharged, when the colon begins to become cancerous, it is often abnormal.



First, the stool is bloody and the mass in the colon is often like cauliflower. Malignant masses are easy to bleed. When the stool passes through the cancerous part, it is easy to cause bleeding due to friction. However, bleeding and hemorrhoids caused by colon cancer are still caused It is different. Bleeding caused by colon cancer is often mixed with blood and stool, while bleeding caused by hemorrhoids is bleeding after the stool.

Second, the stool becomes thinner. As time goes by, the colon lumps become larger and larger, and the lumps block the intestinal cavity. When the stool passes, it is easy to become thinner. This is also the change in the stool characteristics described by the doctor.

Third, it is difficult to pass stool. For the same reason, because the lumps block the intestinal cavity, many people will feel that it is more and more difficult to pass stool over time. If the intestinal cavity is completely blocked, stool cannot pass through, which will also cause The anus stops defecation and exhaust.

Fourth, the bowel habits change. When colon cancer comes, there will be changes in bowel habits. The originally regular bowel habits may suddenly become very irregular. Some patients have fewer bowel movements, and some have more bowel movements.

If you have all the above four signs, you must pay attention to it. Colon cancer is a highly malignant cancer. If it is not detected in time, distant metastasis may occur.</h2>

      <h3>Cancer is not terrible, it is terrible that cancer cells will spread! If these 4 phenomena occur, seek medical attention immediately</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Cancer is not terrible, it is terrible that cancer cells will spread! If these 4 phenomena occur, seek medical attention immediately



The scary thing about cancer is that it is more difficult to cure, because after cancer cells appear in the body, there are usually no obvious symptoms in the early stage, and they are often ignored. When the obvious symptoms appear, the cancer cells have spread and the disease has already reached the stage. In the late stage, it is more difficult to treat at this time.

Even after some cancer cells spread, they basically lose the meaning of treatment. In fact, many cancers have signals when they spread. If you can catch these signals, you can have a ray of life. So what are the signs of cancer cell spread?



1. Lumps appear on the body and keep growing

In the early stage of cancer cell development, the tumor may be relatively small and difficult to find. When the tumor slowly grows up, pay attention to observation. This may be a symptom of the spread of cancer cells, and the disease may have reached the middle to late stage.

Usually, any part of the body, such as the breast, abdomen, or neck, has some swelling, and it gradually grows larger. No matter how small or how big it is, you must go to the hospital for examination in time.

2. The pigmented moles of the body are abnormal

Almost everyone will have pigmented moles, and some moles will not change, then these are benign, but some moles will suddenly enlarge, and even have symptoms of pus or bleeding. This is a common melanoma.

Melanoma will quickly spread to the liver and lungs in a short period of time, causing serious damage to the body. Therefore, some moles on the body are found to have uneven edges, and the surface is rough, and accompanied by a burning sensation. , It is necessary to go to the dermatology department of a regular hospital for examination in time, and start treatment in time after the cause is clear.



3. If cancer cells spread, there will be pain in different parts

When the cancer cells in the body spread, there will be pain.

For example, after liver cancer has spread and metastasized, the tumor will stretch and compress the liver capsule, and the patient will experience dull pain in the upper right abdomen. In addition, gastric cancer patients are caring patients, and if the anastomosis recurs, there will be dull upper abdominal pain.

Therefore, when there are some unexplained pains, it is best to go to the hospital for CT examination.

4. Appetite decreased significantly

Studies have found that about 33% to 75% of patients will have symptoms of anorexia, and during the development of cancer, the incidence of anorexia will reach 80%, so there is a decrease in appetite, so you can also go to the hospital for examination in advance. Prevent the spread of cancer cells.

In addition, the spread of cancer cells also has certain conditions. The phenomenon of metastasis and spread may only occur within 1 to 2 cm, and the cancer will not metastasize in the early stage of the disease.



In summary, the above four signs will appear after cancer cells have spread, which is more difficult to treat, but it is not terrible. As long as the patient can ensure confidence in the treatment and actively cooperate with the doctor's treatment, the cure can be achieved.

It is reminded that the diet should maintain a balanced nutrition, with a light diet, not a partial eclipse, let alone overeating. In addition, we must maintain an optimistic mood, do not be overly nervous, and participate in physical exercises appropriately, which can play a certain role in preventing the recurrence of cancer.</p>

      <h3>Both mother and daughter were suffering from cancer and died after 3 months. Doctor: How can these 3 things be put in the porridge?</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Both mother and daughter were suffering from cancer and died after 3 months. Doctor: How can these 3 things be put in the porridge?

In recent years, the number of people suffering from cancer has been increasing year by year. According to surveys, our country has 3.07 million new cancer patients every year, which has seriously endangered our health.

There is a good saying, it is called "disease comes from the mouth." Cancer is a disease that can be caught at once. It is absolutely inseparable from the food we eat every day. Academician Sun Yan once said: "For There is no trick to fighting cancer. As long as you keep your mouth shut, don't eat foods that harm your body and cause cancer, and prevent the intrusion of toxins from the root, the disease will naturally disappear."



Ms. Li loves to drink peanut porridge. Her mother knows that Ms. Li loves peanut porridge, so she often buys some peanuts to keep at home. Usually the mother and daughter drink peanut porridge every day. Around August, Ms. Li always felt a little pain in her stomach, but she didn't take it seriously if she only occasionally hurts. About ten days later, Ms. Li's condition did not improve. Her mother also started to have stomach pains.



This incident made Ms. Li feel very abnormal, so Ms. Li went to the hospital for inspection. After a series of physical examinations, the doctor gave a diagnosis of liver cancer, and both mother and daughter had advanced liver cancer. The mother and daughter cried in each other's arms, but it was too late.



After communicating with the doctor in detail, the doctor said: It may be the peanuts in the peanut porridge you drink every day. You may not know that there are many things that cannot be put in the porridge.

The doctor said: These 3 kinds of foods damage the body, eat them every day, they may feed cancer cells

1. Peanuts with folds and yellowish color

After peanuts become moldy and bitter, I believe that everyone will not eat them again, but you may overlook one point, that is, peanuts that have become wrinkled and yellow in color, because when peanuts become like this, most of them are already Has gone bad.



After peanuts become moldy and bitter, I believe that everyone will not eat them again, but you may overlook one point, that is, peanuts that have become wrinkled and yellow in color, because when peanuts become like this, most of them are already Has gone bad.

A lot of carcinogens will grow in the peanuts that are wrinkled and yellow, including aflatoxin. Studies have found that only 20UG of aflatoxin can be fatal, and long-term intake of aflatoxin It can cause cancer in liver cells and affect health.

Aflatoxin is widely present in our daily life. In addition to peanuts that are wrinkled and yellowed, they cannot be eaten. Moldy foods and long-term soaked fungi will also produce a large amount of aflatoxin. These foods are all It cannot be eaten.

2. Speckled sweet potatoes

After the sweet potato is placed for a long time, black spots will appear on the surface of the sweet potato. This phenomenon occurs mostly because the red is contaminated by the black spot pathogen. Frequent eating of this kind of sweet potato with black spots will cause poisoning, serious It can also cause cancer and endanger life.



3. Sprouted potatoes

Most of us buy a lot of potatoes when they buy potatoes, because potatoes are not like green vegetables, which can be stored for a long time, but everyone must remember that moldy potatoes are not edible, and the same is true for sprouted potatoes. According to research, potatoes will produce a large amount of solanine after germination, too much consumption will cause poisoning, long-term consumption will cause edema in liver and other organs, which will affect health.



To maintain the liver, you must drink plenty of water. Sufficient supplementation of water can promote liver detoxification and increase the body's metabolic capacity. Usually, you should exercise more, don't stay up late, and develop good work and rest habits is the best protection for the liver.</p>

      <h3>Be careful! These 6 types of cancer have "family aggregation"!</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Be careful! These 6 types of cancer have "family aggregation"!

1. Breast cancer: the risk of daughters is 2~3 times higher

According to Chen Xiuchun, chief physician of the Department of Breast Cancer, Henan Cancer Hospital, the study found that 20% to 25% of breast cancer patients have family clusters, of which 55% to 60% belong to hereditary breast cancer, which accounts for 5% of the total breast cancer. ~10%.

Breast cancer has a genetic predisposition. Generally speaking, mothers get breast cancer and their daughters are 2 to 3 times more likely to get breast cancer than other women. It is clinically recommended that high-risk groups should conduct regular self-examinations and go to the hospital for physical examination once a year to achieve early detection, early diagnosis and early treatment.

At the same time, pay attention to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, regular exercise, healthy eating, reasonable sleep, etc., which can reduce the risk of disease. ②

2. Bowel cancer: 20%~30% of bowel cancer patients have family history

According to Deng Wenying, chief physician of the Department of Oncology, Henan Cancer Hospital, 20% to 30% of colorectal cancer patients have a family history of various cancers. If an elderly person in the family suffers from bowel cancer, it does not mean that the child will also get cancer, but in the same living environment, it is more likely to develop cancer than other people.

Relatives of patients with bowel cancer should undergo colonoscopy as soon as possible, so that colorectal cancer can be detected and treated as soon as possible. If there are patients with colorectal cancer in the family, their immediate family members should pay attention to whether they have changes in bowel habits and bowel traits, whether they have constipation, increased stool frequency, pus and blood in the stool, and abdominal pain, bloating, or intestinal obstruction. If the above symptoms occur, go to the hospital for fecal occult blood test, digital rectal examination, and colonoscopy. ②

3. Ovarian cancer: heredity is mostly caused by genetic mutations

Wu Xiaohua, director of the Department of Oncology and Gynecology of Fudan University Cancer Hospital, said that the main feature of this type of ovarian cancer is family clustering, and the "true culprit" that causes hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome is the BRCA1/2 gene mutation.

These two genes BRCA1/2 are important genes that "inhibit" cell canceration. Once a mutation occurs, the valve of "inhibition" canceration is opened, which leads to a higher risk of canceration.

Studies have shown that over 90% of hereditary ovarian cancers are caused by BRCA1/2 gene mutations. For women with a family history of ovarian cancer or breast cancer, it is recommended to use genetic testing or effective genetic counseling to confirm that people with BRCA1/2 gene mutations can undergo preventive resection after evaluation by a professional doctor to avoid ovarian cancer or breast cancer. risk.

In addition, there are already many drugs targeting BRCA1/2 gene targets on the market. Identifying gene mutations can significantly help to obtain cutting-edge treatment options. ②

4. Gastric cancer: an obvious family gathering phenomenon

According to Chen Suqiong, chief physician of the Department of Oncology, Yinchuan First People's Hospital, gastric cancer is not a genetic disease. However, if a person has a family history, the incidence is relatively higher than that of no family history.

Gastric cancer has obvious family clustering phenomenon, there are two main reasons:

The first is genetic susceptibility. It is possible that there are common living habits and genetic inheritance in the family, so there may be susceptibility, but it does not mean that it must be a genetic disease.

In addition, a large number of clinical data prove that the offspring of patients with gastric cancer in the family do not necessarily have gastric cancer. However, dietary habits and the increase of certain carcinogens in the environment that everyone is exposed to can indeed increase the body's susceptibility to cancer.

For familial gastric cancer, it is recommended to do regular screening and advance prevention. If symptoms such as upper abdominal pain, stomach swelling, and unexplained weight loss often occur, you should also go to the hospital for diagnosis as soon as possible. ②

5. Liver cancer: children are targeted for primary prevention

According to Wang Qian, deputy chief physician of the Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery of Henan Cancer Hospital, if parents are diagnosed with liver cancer, their children are the primary prevention targets. Because of the vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus, it is easy to cause the tendency of family gathering of liver cancer. Especially mothers with hepatitis B virus have a higher chance of liver cancer in their offspring.

Liver cancer is mainly related to infection. For example, if one person in a family has hepatitis B or C, other family members are easily infected. The high-risk group of liver cancer is patients with chronic viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis caused by various reasons. However, as long as the patients with hepatitis are controlled in time, actively treat the hepatitis and block its development process, which will help to avoid the occurrence of liver cancer.

If you have hepatitis patients in your home, you should be vaccinated regularly. At the same time, it is recommended to adopt a split meal system to avoid cross-use of tableware at home and reduce hepatitis infection. There is a liver cancer patient in the family, and their children must undergo a comprehensive liver examination, such as liver function, B-ultrasound, etc., regardless of their health. ②

6. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: there is an obvious family genetic predisposition

Deng Qinghua, director of the Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy of Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, said that several people in the same family have suffered from nasopharyngeal cancer at the same time. Analysis of the cause, genetics is the basis and a factor that cannot be ignored. Studies have found that people with a family history of nasopharyngeal cancer are 20-40 times more likely to develop the disease than normal people.

One of the items in the routine physical examination is to check the nose. Many people think it’s okay not to do it. In fact, this can be screened for nasopharyngeal cancer. If the location of the nasopharyngeal tumor is not particularly hidden, an experienced ENT doctor can basically see the lesion during the examination. The current clinical EB virus detection is also an important auxiliary diagnostic method for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. If anyone in the family has ever had nasopharyngeal cancer, I suggest you go to the hospital for a nasoscopy and Epstein-Barr virus test.</p>

      <h3>Chinese medicine injections participate in the fight against the new coronavirus</h3>
      <p contenteditable>Chinese medicine injections participate in the fight against the new coronavirus


"In order to convince people with traditional Chinese medicine injections, you must use data and evidence to speak, and you must also form a chain of evidence. One piece of evidence is too lonely, and several pieces of evidence around a clinical issue form an evidence group, which is invincible. Land.” Talking about the related issues of Chinese medicine injections, Zhang Boli, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, expressed this view in an interview with the "China Science News".

As a member of the expert group of the Central Steering Group for the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, Zhang Boli spent 82 days in Wuhan. He believes that in the treatment of the new crown pneumonia, the combination of Chinese and Western medicine is the highlight of the Chinese plan. Moreover, Jiangxia Fangcang, the only traditional Chinese medicine shelter hospital, mainly uses integrated Chinese medicine treatment. In the end, none of the patients became severely ill, and the medical staff also had zero infections.

On March 23, at a press conference held by the Information Office of the State Council in Wuhan, Zhang Boli recommended the "three medicines and three prescriptions", namely Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Huashi Baidu Recipe, Xuanfei Baidu Recipe, Jinhua Qinggan Granules, Lian Huaqingwen Capsule, Xuebijing Injection (hereinafter referred to as Xuebijing). Among them, Xuebijing was selected as the only Chinese medicine injection.

"This means that the efficacy and safety of Xuebijing have been jointly recognized by the Central Guiding Expert Group of Chinese and Western medicine experts, and have been confirmed at the national level." said Qiu Haibo, deputy dean of Zhongda Hospital affiliated to Southeast University.

On April 12, the National Medical Products Administration approved Xuebijing's new indications "can be used for severe and critical systemic inflammatory response syndrome or/and multiple organ failure with new coronavirus pneumonia."

"Xuebijing is mainly a prescription for promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Initially, it appears to be effective against new coronary pneumonia and reduces the fatality rate. However, some evidence-based medical evidence is still needed." In the live interview of "Nanshan Breath", Zhong Nanshan, leader of the high-level expert group of the National Health Commission and academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said when answering questions about the new crown pneumonia epidemic.

Initiate new evidence-based research

Time is pulled back to the early stage of the outbreak of new coronary pneumonia. How to scientifically prevent and treat patients with severe new coronary pneumonia has become the most urgent problem.

As a new coronavirus, scientists still don't know much about it. The members of the expert group can only select those drugs that may be effective against new coronary pneumonia. This includes not only the antiviral therapy drugs lopinavir/ritonavir, the glucocorticoid drug methylprednisolone, etc., but also the traditional Chinese medicine injection Xuebijing and Xiyanping.

"Most patients with severe pneumonia have sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. There is no evidence that existing chemical or biological drugs can reduce the mortality of these patients and improve the prognosis." Professor of Respiratory Department, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University Song Yuanlin told the Chinese Journal of Science that there were few reports on clinical trials of drugs for the treatment of severe pneumonia in adults after searching international literature in the past 20 years. This is because the condition of critically ill patients is very complicated and it is difficult to carry out research according to fixed conditions.

It is worth mentioning that in September last year, under the guidance of Zhong Nanshan and Zhang Boli, the Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University and 33 tertiary hospitals completed the "Xuebijing in the treatment of severe pneumonia randomized controlled trial" after ten years. Related papers were published in the American Journal of Critical Care Medicine. The results of the study show that Xuebijing can significantly reduce the mortality of patients with severe pneumonia, increase the rate of improvement of pneumonia index risk rating, and shorten the time of mechanical ventilation and ICU treatment.

It is also based on the evidence-based medical evidence that Xuebijing reduces the 28-day mortality rate of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia combined with sepsis. On January 21, Zhong Nanshan served as the research project leader and initiated the “Xuebijing injection treatment” Clinical and mechanism research on the curative effect of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus infection" to evaluate the effects of Xuebijing on acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood coagulation dysfunction, septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and other serious life-threatening patients with new coronary pneumonia. The blocking and improving effect of complications.

Clinical effect recognized by experts

The preliminary results of the study show that Xuebijing can significantly inhibit the excessive release of inflammatory factors or "inflammatory storms" induced by the new coronavirus. On the basis of conventional treatment, United Xuebijing has an effective rate of 91% in the treatment of severe patients with new coronary pneumonia.

This conclusion has also been recognized by many respiratory and critical medicine experts.

At a press conference held by the State Council Information Office in Wuhan, Qiu Haibo said that traditional Chinese medicine has already seen curative effects in the process of transforming ordinary and severe forms. It has played a certain role in the treatment of severe cases and is also very important in rehabilitation. effect.

"From the perspective of Western medicine, most chemical drugs are single-targeted, while Chinese medicine and Chinese medicine are more multi-targeted. In other words, Chinese medicine is more like a team fighting. This treatment mode is different from Chinese and Western medicine. Qiu Haibo took Xuebijing as an example, and pointed out that it has at least 6 active ingredients that have been proven, and it has the advantages of comprehensive treatment of complex diseases with traditional Chinese medicine "multi-component-multi-target-multi-pathway". Related in vitro experiments also proved that Xuebijing has an inhibitory effect on the replication of the new coronavirus. In related animal experiments, Xuebijing has a curative effect on inflammation and coagulopathy.

Talking about the principle of Xuebijing's containment of inflammatory storms and coagulation dysfunction, Li Zhijun, chairman of the China Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Emergency Medicine Committee, said in an interview with the media that once the "inflammatory storm" and the "coagulation storm" form a vicious interaction, it is A sign of worsening illness, if it worsens, the patient may experience shock and organ failure, and the mortality rate will increase significantly. If Xuebijing is used in the early stage of the disease, it can not only protect the vascular endothelial cells damaged by systemic inflammatory response syndrome, reduce capillary leakage, but also reduce the formation of capillary microthrombosis, thereby reducing the incidence of coagulopathy and cutting off the condition The progression from toxic fever to blood stasis.

Talking about the safety of traditional Chinese medicine injections, Qiu Haibo said that the side effects of Xuebijing are not higher than 1% of clinical use, "so it is basically safe."

Still need further evidence-based medical evidence

The reporter noticed that several versions of the "New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Plan" and the "New Coronavirus Pneumonia Severe and Critical Case Diagnosis and Treatment Plan" promulgated by the National Health Commission all have special Chinese medicine treatment plans, including Chinese medicine decoctions, Chinese patent medicine, Chinese medicine injection, etc. Among them, Xuebijing is the only recommended drug written in two treatment programs of Western medicine and Chinese medicine, and is promoted to the world as the "three drugs and three prescriptions" of the "Chinese program".

It is understood that Xuebijing is an intravenous preparation selected by Professor Wang Jinda of Tianjin First Central Hospital based on the ancient prescription Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction. It has been successfully developed after 30 years. It is composed of safflower, red peony, chuanxiong, salvia and angelica. It has the functions of promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis, cooling blood and nourishing blood, and dispersing toxins. It is indicated for the treatment of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome induced by infection. Because of its clear efficacy in treating SARS patients, Xuebijing entered the green channel for rapid approval of new anti-SARS drugs and was approved for marketing in early 2004. It is currently the exclusive product of Hongri Pharmaceutical.

During the interview, Yao Xiaoqing, the founder and chairman of Hongri Pharmaceuticals, told the China Science Daily that after Xuebijing was listed, in order to further verify its effectiveness and safety, and provide guidance for clinical applications, they focused on Xuebijing The material basis, pharmacological effects, clinical efficacy and safety of the company have carried out a series of evidence-based medicine research for more than ten years.

Up to now, China has carried out "Randomized Controlled Trials of Xuebijing in the Treatment of Severe Pneumonia", "Randomized Controlled Trials of Xuebijing in the Treatment of Sepsis" and "Randomized Controlled Trials of Xuebijing in the Treatment of Severe Sepsis with DIC" "Randomized Controlled Trial of Xuebijing's Efficacy in Treating AECOPD" and "Clinical Safety Centralized Monitoring Study of Xuebijing after Marketing".

"But the new crown pneumonia epidemic is a very large public health event. At present, Xuebijing is mainly applied to patients with very severe inflammation, so the final clinical research results need further analysis." Qiu Haibo said.

In addition, Zhong Nanshan emphasized that whether TCM and Western medicine are effective cannot be based on impressions, but must be proved by modern evidence-based medicine. Effectiveness must be promoted. New coronary pneumonia is a new problem, and there must be evidence to see if it is effective. Only by obtaining solid data and confirming that the treatment is effective can it be better promoted at home and abroad.</p>

      <h3>The total effective rate of Chinese medicine in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia is more than 90%</h3>
      <p contenteditable>“Of the confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the country, 74,187 people have used Chinese medicine, accounting for 91.5%, of which 61,449 people in Hubei Province have used Chinese medicine, accounting for 90.6%. Observations of clinical efficacy show that the total effective rate of Chinese medicine has reached 90%. Above. Traditional Chinese medicine can effectively relieve symptoms, reduce the development of mild and common types to severe, increase the cure rate, reduce the mortality rate, and promote the recovery of people in the recovery period. All walks of life believe that Chinese medicine has played an important role and became this epidemic. A highlight of prevention and control." On the afternoon of March 23, the State Council Information Office held a press conference in Wuhan, Hubei Province, said Yu Yanhong, a member of the Central Steering Group, a member of the Party Group of the National Health Commission, and Secretary of the Party Group of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Zhang Boli, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and President of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, also said at the meeting, “Practice has proved that early intervention and full participation of traditional Chinese medicine have played an important role in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia." If the prevention and control of the new coronary pneumonia epidemic is regarded as a parabola, Traditional Chinese medicine will work better at both ends. "At present, although we do not have specific medicines, Chinese medicine has already come up with an effective plan. In particular, the combination of Chinese and Western medicine is a bright spot in China's fight against new coronary pneumonia."

According to the analysis of the World Health Organization, nearly 13% of patients with new coronary pneumonia will become severely ill, and 7% of patients may become critically ill. However, in Jiangxia Fangcai Hospital, which was taken over by the "national team" of Chinese medicine, as of March 10, it was officially "closed" and "none of the 564 patients became severe."

According to Yu Yanhong, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine has carried out simultaneous observations on the clinical efficacy of proprietary Chinese medicines and prescriptions that have been included in the fifth, sixth, and seventh editions of the diagnosis and treatment plan, and screened out the "three-drug three-prescriptions" that have obvious effects on the treatment of new coronary pneumonia. ": Jinhua Qinggan Granules, Lianhua Qingwen Capsules, Xuebijing Injection, as well as Qingfei Paidu Decoction, Dampness Dispelling Decoction, Xuanfei Baidu Decoction.

"Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have obvious differences in treatment modes. Most chemical drugs in Western medicine are single-target treatments, while Chinese medicine is more multi-target treatment. Chinese medicine is more like'a team in combat'. "Said Qiu Haibo, vice president of Zhongda Hospital affiliated to Southeast University, "Chemical drugs are often targeted at a certain target, while Chinese medicine may be a multi-target therapy." A study of 156 patients involving 32 hospitals showed that basic treatment was added. After Shangxue Bijing injection, the effective rate is relatively high.

Liu Qingquan, president of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said that in the treatment of new coronary pneumonia, many traditional Chinese medicine "old medicines and new applications" have achieved good results. Jinhua Qinggan Granules and Lianhua Qingwen Capsules are good examples.

"Jinhua Qinggan Granules is a new medicine developed for H1N1 influenza in 2009. It is composed of Maxing Shigan Decoction and Yinqiao Powder." Zhang Boli said.

During the epidemic, the expert team conducted a clinical controlled study on 102 patients. The results showed that compared with ordinary patients, the proportion of patients taking Jinhua Qinggan Granules decreased by 2/3, and the fever reduction time was shortened by 1.5 days. The time for the test to turn negative was reduced by 2.5 days.

Zhang Boli introduced that Lianhua Qingwen Capsule was a prescription developed during SARS. During the new coronary pneumonia epidemic, clinical research results showed that the disappearance rate of main clinical symptoms and the duration of clinical symptoms in patients taking Lianhua Qingwen Capsules were better than those of the control group, and the improvement rate of lung imaging reached 83.8%. The clinical cure rate reached 78.9%.

In addition, the "three prescriptions" in the "three medicines and three prescriptions" is also a model of "old medicine renovation".

Huang Luqi, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and dean of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, said that the Qingfei Paidu Decoction is derived from Maxing Shigan Decoction, Shegan Mahuang Decoction, Xiao Chaihu Decoction, Wuling Powder, etc. Clinical observations of 57 critically ill patients treated with integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine and taking Qingfei Paidu Decoction showed that 42 patients were cured and discharged, accounting for 73.7%, and none of them became critically ill. The lung imaging comparison of the patients showed that after taking Qingfei Paidu Decoction for two courses (6 days), the lung lesions of 53 patients showed different degrees of reduction and absorption.

Xuanfei Baidu Recipe is condensed on the basis of classic recipes such as Maxing Shigan Decoction and Maxing Yigan Decoction. The Xuanfeibaidu group (70 cases) and the control group (50 cases) conducted in Wuhan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine and other units showed that Xuanfeibaidu Decoction is effective in controlling inflammation and increasing lymphocyte counts. It has significant curative effect. Compared with the control group, the recovery of lymphocytes is increased by 17%, and the clinical cure rate can be increased by 22%.

Huashibaidu Recipe is optimized by the medical team of the Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Jinyintan Hospital on the basis of the prescriptions recommended by the national diagnosis and treatment plan. The clinical controlled trial of Jinyintan Hospital enrolled 75 critically ill patients. The pulmonary inflammation and clinical symptoms diagnosed by CT were significantly improved, and the time for nucleic acid conversion and hospitalization were shortened by an average of 3 days.

Yu Yanhong, secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said that at present, my country has shared its experience in Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment with Japan, South Korea, the United States, Italy and other countries. It has sent Chinese medicine experts to Italy, Cambodia and other countries and provided a variety of Chinese medicines. China is willing to carry out international cooperation on Chinese medicine to participate in epidemic prevention and control with countries in need, and provide assistance within its capacity.</p>
